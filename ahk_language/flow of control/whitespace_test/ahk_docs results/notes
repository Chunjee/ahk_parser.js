only "if" remained a whiteSpace
perhaps it's an ACTUAL if statement ? (need to test)

so this is what we got: #Include and #IncludeAgain are directives... so...

  "#Include":["error message", "OK
  Error at line 15.

  #Include file "\ahk_parser.js\ahk_language\flow of control\whitespace_test\:=4" cannot be opened.

  The program will exit.
  "]
  "#IncludeAgain":["error message", "OK
  Error at line 15.

  #Include file "\ahk_parser.js\ahk_language\flow of control\whitespace_test\:=4" cannot be opened.

  The program will exit.
  "]
  "If":whiteSpace
