move c past whitespaces

if it doesn't start with /*

if char===';' skip rest of line


string:

if ", and if next c+1 < length, if c+1==='"'


FUNCTION:
  get alphaNum, if not a number like 123(), it's a function.


finding a *.d.ts bundler (typescript declaration files):
  tried (didn't wor):
    ts-loader: declaration-bundler-webpack-plugin
      https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader#declarations-dts
      https://www.npmjs.com/package/declaration-bundler-webpack-plugin
    dts-bundle-generator:
      Project seems dead. dts-bundle-generator looks like an alternative. #83
        https://github.com/TypeStrong/dts-bundle/issues/83
      https://github.com/timocov/dts-bundle-generator
  dts-bundle worked:
    https://github.com/TypeStrong/dts-bundle


src -> src/parser/ and src/usage.ts
because I don't want usage.ts to be bundled.


webpack.config.js -> build\webpack.config.js with build\dtsBundle.js & build\unlink_d.ts.js


`yarn declarations`(tsc --emitDeclarationOnly) isn't needed because `yarn webpackProd` somehow produces the declaration files...
  note the "include": ["src/parser/**/*.ts"], (in tsconfig.json) `yarn webpackProd` somehow respects that


removed sourcemaps (I don't think I need sourcemap in prod):
(idk what options do) https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/
removed:
  (package.json) webpack --devtool hidden-source-map
  (webpack.config.js) // devtool: 'nosources-source-map',


(webpack.config.js)    
//https://webpack.js.org/guides/author-libraries/#expose-the-library
    library: {
      name: 'ahkParser',
      type: 'umd',
},
idk what library.name does, but I'm using camelCase because the example is `library: "webpackNumbers",`
it seems that it's used in script tag
<script>
  window.webpackNumbers.wordToNum('Five');
</script>
